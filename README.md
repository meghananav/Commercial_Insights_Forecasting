## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/meghananav/Commercial_Insights_Forecasting.git
cd Commercial_Insights_Forecasting

2.Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage

3.Open the notebook:
notebooks/Commercial_Insights_Forecasting.ipynb


4.Run the notebook to:
   -Load and preprocess data from data/processed/
   -Train and evaluate models (XGBoost & Prophet)
   -Generate forecasts and visualizations

5.Use the saved models from models/ to make predictions without retraining.

6.Open in Colab

You can safely open and run this notebook in Google Colab using the button below. This will create a copy in your Colab environment and will not give access to my private files:

7.Models Used
Model	Description
XGBoost	Gradient boosting model optimized for accurate numerical forecasting
Prophet	Time series model for capturing trends and seasonal patterns

8.Results
Example metrics:
-XGBoost RMSE: 120.45
-Prophet MAE: 95.32
Visualizations in the notebook show predicted vs actual trends, seasonal patterns, and residual errors.

9.Data
Sample processed datasets included in data/processed/
Full datasets can be obtained from [source/link] or by contacting the author
Large raw datasets excluded to keep the repository lightweight
